# Chicago Crime Database

Chicago Crime Database provides comprehensive information on reported crimes within a subset of locations and attributes of
incidents. The purpose of the application is to create a relational database system that tracks, stores, and visualizes
reported crime incidents across Washington, D.C. The application will use a real-world dataset provided by the District
of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). The dataset will help discover crime patterns and aid in strategic
decision-making for community safety and law enforcement.
